                    <p>This 3D model was entered in to a mindsumo.com challenge where companies challenege students to complete questions or submit content to be rated.
                        My submission included this droid, along with one other to go on to receive an honorable mention. I learned a lot about Fusion 360, as it was brand new to the modelling scene. I learned the placement of features were in Fusion 360. </p>

                    <p> AutoDesk held another mindsumo.com challenge and this was one of my submissions. I may not have won, but I did learn more about the Fusion 360 environment. I learned where tools like the animation and fillet tools where located in Fusion 360.</p>

                    <p>Intelligrated - Automation company, specifically in the conveyor belt systems. I worked on AutoCAD models and layouts for a few UPS and Amazon projects.
                        Most of these designs were in 2D, but I worked on 3D models in my last month of the rotation. I learned the importance of representing designs in a proper way for installers
                        and I got the chance to implement these skills. This is really important to me, because finding better ways for others to understand a concept is very important as an engineer. 
                        During the Honeywell acquisition, I learned that Intelligrated was in no direct danger but was pushed to continue to grow. This is very important as I was under the impression that a lot
                        of acquisition tend to be awkward and shut down sections of the acquired company.

                    <p>KLH Engineers - MEP firm located in Nothern Kentucky. I worked on AutoCAD and Revit building designs, specifically with Electrical plans. This includes lighting and the power systems for Healthcare and Commercial buildings.
                        I learned the importance of site surveys and how to carry one out solo. This was a major self confidence booster, and helped me see another perspective regarding building design.
                        I learned Revit from scratch and successfully completed 5+ projects in the software. I love learning new softwares/languages and Revit is now one more tool under my belt.
